patched-broadcom-wl-broadcom-sta
================================

Broadcom-sta drivers (x64) already patched for kernel 3.17 (and probably others).

Just enable CFG80211 as module, and disable kernel debugging (in kernel hacking) before compiling the kernel.

I've used Krejzi (great) patches form https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/broadcom-wl/

Also includes the complied module.
