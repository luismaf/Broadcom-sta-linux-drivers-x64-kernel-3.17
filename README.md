patched-broadcom-wl-broadcom-sta
=================================

broadcom-sta drivers already patched for kernel 3.14.3.

Just enable CFG80211 as module, and disable kernel debugging (in kernel hacking) before compiling the kernel.

Also includes the complied module.

I've used Krejzi (great) patches form https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/broadcom-wl/
